When users navigate to different URLs, React Router matches the path specified in <Route> and renders the corresponding component.
The <Navbar /> remains visible on every page because it is placed outside the <Routes> component.
<Routes> is a container component from React Router that looks through its children <Route> elements and renders the first one that matches the current URL.
